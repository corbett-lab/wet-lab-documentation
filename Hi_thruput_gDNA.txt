Fly Lysis:
Complete lysis buffer recipe per lysis:








1. Prepare flies on 96 well plate and keep on ice.
2. Make a master mix of complete lysis buffer and add entire volume to a reagent reservoir.
3. Use the P200 multichannel to aspirate 70 uL of lysis solution and with the pipette tip crush the flies and slowly release the liquid as you crush.
4. Continue to squish the flies until solution changes color and bodies are well squished.
5. Repeat for all wells.
6. Tightly seal plate with several foils and spin down briefly to draw liquid to bottom of well.
7. Place into thermocycler under following conditions:
55C 18 hours
68C 1 hour
Hold 4C
Note:
Lysis could probably be reduced to less time, but I wouldnâ€™t go under 6-8 hours.


DNA extraction:
1. Bring SPRI/Ampure XP beads up to room temperature ~ 20 minutes.
2. Vortex briefly then spin down plate to get chitin to float to bottom.
3. Collect 50uL of lysate from each well being careful not draw bodies/chitin and deposit into new 96 well plate.
4. Add 75uL of SPRI beads to each well containing the lysate and pipette to mix ~10 times.
5. Incubate at room temperature for 5-10 minutes.
6. Use magnet to pellet beads and discard supernatant
7. Wash with 180uL of 80% EtOH on the magnet by pipetting up and down. Repeat 3x
8. Spin down plate to draw remaining EtOH to bottom and remove with P10 multichannel.
9. Allow to air dry until pellet has begun to crack ~10 minutes.
10. Resuspend the pellet in 20uL of DEPC H2O to elute.
11. Incubate at room temperature for 5-10 minutes.
12. Place on magnet until solution is clear and collect 18.5uL of supernatant and place into fresh 96 well plate. 
13. Use Qubit/Plate reader to quantify genomic DNA.

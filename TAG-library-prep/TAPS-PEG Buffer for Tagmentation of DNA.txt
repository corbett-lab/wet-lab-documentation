Reagents required:

1M sol’n MgCl2
TAPS
PEG 8000
10M sol’n NaOH
Ultrapure H20

Protocol: 

(Amounts given are for the creation of 100 mL of buffer). 

1. Place 50 mL of UP H20 in a 125 mL autoclaved flask, and use an autoclaved magnetic stir bar to keep the solution stirring. 


2. Add 25.28 g TAPS and allow to dissolve. 


3. Add 5.210 mL 10M NaOH and allow solution to homogenize.


4. Measure pH - it should measure 8.50 +-.01


5. Add 2.5 mL 1M MgCl2


6. In another 125 mL autoclaved flask, add a magnetic stir bar, and on top of that add 40g PEG 8000. 


7. Pour the first flask over the contents of the second. This is to avoid the PEG 8000 forming a gel-like layer as soon as it falls into contact with the water, preventing the formation of a homogenuous mixture. 

8. Cover the second solution with parafilm and leave it stirring overnight. 


9. Using a serological pipet, pull the buffer out in 10 mL increments (+ one 5 m increment), adding 45 mL to each of two 50 mL falcon tubes. 


10. Add 10 mL UP H20 to the flask containing the stir bar and remnants of the buffer and swirl, aiming to take the residue off the sides. Take 5 mL of this and add to each falcon tube, for a total volume of 50 mL.

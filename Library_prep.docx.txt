Tagmentation:
Load Tn5:


Reagents:
• 100 uM Tn5 A and B oligo
• 100 uM Tn5 R oligo
1. Add equal volumes of 100 uM A oligo to R oligo
2. Add equal volumes of 100 uM B oligo to R oligo
3.  Anneal using:
95C 5 minutes
25C (-0.1C/s)
Hold 25C
4. Add .143uL of annealed oligo to 1 uL of Tn5 per rxn and incubate for 1 hour at RT
5. Add equal volumes of A Tn5 and B Tn5 in tube and mix via pipetting.
        DNA tagmentation:
        Per rxn:
Tn5
	1uL
	DEPC H2O
	14uL
	5x TAPS-PEG 8000
	4uL
	DNA input
	1uL
	Total volume
	20uL
	

1. Incubate each reaction at 55C for 7 minutes.
2. Kill Tn5 by adding 5uL of .2% SDS and let sit at RT for 7 minutes
PCR Indexing and amplification:
1. Make a master mix with the following per rxn:
DEPC H2O
	11.75uL
	5x KAPA HiFi buffer
	5uL
	dNTPs
	.75uL
	HiFi polymerase
	.5uL
	Total
	18uL
	1. Add separately to each rxn:




i7 index primer
	1uL
	i5 index primer
	1uL
	Tn5 product
	5uL
	Total
	25uL
	

Run on following protocol:
1. 72C 5 minutes
2. 95C 3 minutes
3. 98C 20 sec
4. 65C 15 sec
5. 72C 30 sec
6. Repeat from step 2 10x
7. 72C for 5 minutes
8. Hold at 4C
Purify library:
1. Bring AMPURE XP beads up to RT ~20 minutes
2. Add 40uL of beads to each reaction and mix via pipetting 10 times.
3. Let incubate for 5 minutes.
4. Place on magnet until solution is clear and draw out supernatant without disturbing bead pellet
5. Wash bead pellet on magnet 2x with 180uL of 80% EtOH.
6. Spin down and magnet then remove remaining EtOH with P2/10
7. Let air dry till all EtOH has evaporated and pellet begins to crack.
8. Resuspend beads with 15-25 uL of TE/10mM Tris/DEPC H2O and incubate for 2-5 minutes
9. Place on magnet until solution is clear and collect the supernatant and put into fresh .2mL tube
QC:
1. Use Qubit to quantify concentration.
2. Use Tapestation (Social Sciences) to determine fragment size distribution.

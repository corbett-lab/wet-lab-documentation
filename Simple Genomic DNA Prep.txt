Simple Genomic DNA Prep


Reagents
* Squish Buffer
* Proteinase K


Protocol:
1. Collect flies to have their DNA extracted into PCR tubes - either single, rack or plate. Keep these on ice - using either the plate cooler from the freezer, or just a bucket of ice. 
2. Make master mix of 50 µL squish buffer + 1 µL Proteinase K per fly. Vortex well, then spin down. 
3. For each well, pull 50 µL of master mix into a micropipetter, and, keeping the mix in the tube, crush the fly with the pipet tip while slowly releasing the solution. Continue to squish until the fly is thoroughly masticated - a good rule of thumb is when the fly’s eyes are crushed and release their pigment into the master mix, it is sufficiently homogenized. 
4. Place on thermocycler and set the sample for 55 degrees Celsius for 1-24 hours, followed by 15 minutes at 95 degrees Celsius to denature the Proteinase K.

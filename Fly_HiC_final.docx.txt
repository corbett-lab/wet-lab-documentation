3. Crush up flies to fine powder with a plastic pestle

8. Wash with 1 mL ice cold PBS, pellet and then discard supernatant.
9. Add a reasonable number of garnet beads (I usually eyeball this)
10. Add 1mL of Lysis buffer (as per normal recipe)
11. Tape the tubes to the vortexer real good, and turn it on to homogenize the sample for 20-30 minutes, or until fully homogenized. 
12. Place the tubes on ice for 10-15 more minutes to lyse. 
13. Aspirate the lysate using the garnet beads as a filter to get the least amount of chitin into tip and transfer to siliconized tube. (It’s not a big deal if you get some, but the less the better)
14. Pellet for 5 minutes in microcentrifuge tube, and discard supernatant.
15. Wash with 1 mL of Lysate Wash Buffer, pellet for 5 minutes, discard supe.
16. Resuspend pellet in 50uL of Lysate wash buffer +2.5uL of 20% SDS.

18. Quantify 1uL of sample on Qubit 
   1. If measurement is 15ng/uL or less use entire volume for SPRI bead binding
   2. If measurement is >15 ng/uL use an amount equivalent to <800ng total.
   3. Rest can be saved at 4c for 1 week
1. Add 50uL of sample to 100uL of SPRI beads in .2mL tubes; bind for 5-10 minutes. If volume of sample is <50uL fill to 50 with Lysate Wash Buffer
2. Magnet 5 minutes and discard supernatant carefully. Remove as much liquid as possible using P2/10/20 as necessary.
3. Wash 3x with 180uL of HiC SPRI WashBuffer.
